    <h1> Agatha's team</h1>

    <p> Once again we are met by a trainer that appreciates using same type pokemon. Agatha uses ghost and poison. Something unique about Agatha is that her game plan relies heavily on RNG or luck. In other words, she can either be incredibly annoying and tedious to battle or very easy. There is no inbetween.<br> All but one of her pokemon have 1 or more moves that can put a status condition onto your pokemon. They can slept, confused or poisoned. If any of the status condition moves land, you're gonna be in for a tough time. <br> To combat this, be sure you are stocked up on full heals to make sure you can recover quickly. Full heals will clear the sleep or poison but if your pokemon is confused, switching out is the only way to stop it.<br> As for actually battling her pokemon, A pyschic type, like our aforementioned alakazam, is 2x effective against her poison types and immune to her ghost! Neat huh? You could also ditto her with a Gengar of your own. <br> Once you get lucky enough for her to start missing, allowing you to actually play the game and defeat her, you'll head into the final battle!
