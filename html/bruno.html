    <h1>
Bruno's Team
    </h1>
    <p> Similarly to Lorelei, Bruno carries many of one type which, in his case, is fighting. This means that his heavy hitting fighting types are very susceptible to two types, flying and psychic. <br> Looking at his team, one might think to bring a flying type as it should be 2x effective against all his pokemon!<br> While this is the case for his pure fighting types, the two onix negate their weakness because of their dual typing with rock. Rock is also 2x effective against flying. Not to mention his wild card hitmonchan that has the 2x effective move thunderpunch. The correct choice would be a pyschic type, like Alakazam, that can make quick work of his fighting type and a water type to clean up the rock snakes.<br> Now your ready for battle number 3! </p>
