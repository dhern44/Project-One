        <p>You guessed it. The final member of the elite four, virtually uses one pokemon type. Only this time, it may be for good reason. The dragon type is incredibly strong! Not to mention that there is only three dragon types in the game and their all from the same evolution line. <br> Dragonite/dragon type is resistent to four types and only weak to two. One of which is itself. It is the other type it is weak to that makes this beast not quite unbeatable, however. That type is ice. <br>Having an ice type pokemon is pivotal in defeating the dragon master and claiming the title of champion. To fill this role, I would recommend Lapris. Not only is it bulky enough to take a hyper beam or two from the busted dragonite, it can dish out some big damaged with some 4x effective ice moves. As for the rest of his team, a good lighting type, like jolteon, should make quick work of his Gyarados and Aerodactyl. <br> Now you have all the tools you need to defeat the elite four. Go out and claim that sweet sweet victory!
